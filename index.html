            <p>Peter lived a difficult childhood because he was an orphan who was very timid and shy. He was also very
                smart
                but he often got bullied. He lived with his aunt and uncle in New York City. You could also describe him
                as
                a geeky science nerd who consistently seeked attention.</p>
